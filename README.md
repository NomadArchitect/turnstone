**TURNSTONE**: The fUnny opeRatiNg SysTem Of uNivErse
======

This is a custom os project.

The roadmap is at @ref roadmap.

The architecture is at @ref architecture.

##Â Building On OSX

You need packages with macports:
```
x86_64-elf-gcc x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
```

```
make clean gendirs qemu
```

## Building On Linux

There is two options install gcc and gcc-mingw-w64 and:

```
make clean gendirs qemu
```

Or build with container (please ensure that you are inside repo folder):

```
podman run --rm  -v ./:/osdev -w /osdev docker.io/library/gcc:11 scripts/container-build/build.sh
```

You can use docker inside of podman The ```scripts/container-build/build.sh``` script installs gcc-mingw-w64 and runs ```make clean gendirs qemu```.

## Runnig

On both OSX and Linux you need **qemu**.

On Linux you need **edk2-ovmf** package for efi files for qemu. On OSX macports provides them with **qemu**.

For starting a networkless (may be with default network) qemu with OVMF EDK2 uefi bios:

```
scripts/osx-hacks/qemu-efi-hda.sh
```

The qemu terminal will be openned at console and video output will be at tmp/qemu-video.log
